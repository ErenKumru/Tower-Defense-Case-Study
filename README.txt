### About
- A simple tower defense game case study to understand the fundementals of tower defense games and achieve a simple mini-game.
- I already had some turret and spaceship assets beforehand from another project so I decided that the game's theme to be space defense.
- The project was worked on 1440 x 3200 Portrait.
