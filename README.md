## About
- A simple tower defense game case study to understand the fundementals of tower defense games and achieve a simple mini-game.
- I already had some turret and spaceship assets beforehand from another project so I decided that the game's theme to be space defense.
- The project was worked on 1440 x 3200 Portrait.

## Game Design
- Turrets are put randomly on available tiles when bought.
- At each Stage, there are more Monsters to defend against.
- Game continues until a Monster reaches the end of the path.

## Assets
- Monsters, Turrets and Bullets are custom assets.
- Coins and Kill UI assets: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-game-items-131764
